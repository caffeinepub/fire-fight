## Summary
**Goal:** Build a turn-based tactical combat web game with Internet Identity authentication, game lobby system, and leaderboard tracking.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for secure player login
- Create game lobby system for viewing and joining matches
- Build turn-based 2D tactical combat gameplay with top-down battlefield view
- Add health/damage system with win conditions
- Implement leaderboard tracking wins, losses, and rankings
- Design tactical military-inspired UI with bold, energetic colors (avoiding blue and purple)

**User-visible outcome:** Players can authenticate, join game lobbies, engage in turn-based tactical combat matches, and view their ranking on a leaderboard.
